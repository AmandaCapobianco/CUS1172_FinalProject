# CUS1172_FinalProject
Final Project : Create and use an API Web Application.

Instructions:

*make sure you have node.js, express library, and jade template engine installed*

First Clone this repository to your own machine, then run the application by typing node final_api.js 

Next, travel to the index page who's route is located at http://127.0.0.1:3000/ ('/') address.

This index page is generated by a Jade template engine, and also loads the neccessary javascript and css static file resources. index.jade also extends layout.jade, which links the appropriate Bootstrap template.

When on the index page, you can follow the instructions to conduct the specified search queries, which are all handled by their own unique routes.

You can:
Query by Course Code or Prefix    (for example, can try searching "css", "cus1172", "net" etc..)
Query by Course Title             (for example, can try searching "intro", "advanced network routing", "fundamentals" etc..)
Query by Course Instructor        (for example, can try searching "otero", "Christoforou", "thomas" etc..)
Query by Course Meeting Day (M, T, W, R, F)
Query by Course Type (Lecture/Lab/Hybrid/Internship)
Query by Seat Availability (Returns all classes where seats are greater than 0)
Query by Course Instructor AND Course Code/Prefix       (for example, can try searching "otero" and "css", or "greenidge" and "net")
  
  When searching based on these queries, the relevant results will be returned in the form of a list. 
  Each time a new search is conducted, the search results are replaced on the page.
